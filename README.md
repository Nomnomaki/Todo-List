## About & Features

This is a basic todo list web application written with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
The functionality of the app is very simple: you can add new tasks, mark them as done and delete them.

You can also store the tasks in the local storage of your browser but this feature is proper functioning yet as you can see at the end of the "main.js" file there are few lines of code that is commented out.

## Features to add

- [ ] Add the local storage feature that doesn't bring up the deleted tasks and maintains the checkbox status.
